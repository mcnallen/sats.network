## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `index.html` | HTML structure and layout |
| `styles.css` | All styling |
| `app.js` | Application logic and API integrations |

## Deployment

Upload all files to any web server — no Node.js, no build step required.

For example, upload to a `/bitcoin-bitwatch/` subfolder on your hosting and access it directly at `yourdomain.com/bitcoin-bitwatch/`.

### WordPress Integration

To embed BitWatch in a WordPress page, create a page template that loads the app in an iframe:

```php
<iframe
  src="/bitcoin-bitwatch/index.html"
  style="width:100%;min-height:100vh;border:none;display:block;"
  title="BitWatch Portfolio Tracker"
></iframe>
```

## Data Storage

All data is stored in the browser's localStorage — nothing is sent to any server. Your data stays on your device.

- `bitwatch_addresses` — Monitored Bitcoin addresses
- `bitwatch_alerts` — Transaction alerts (max 25)
- `bitwatch_settings` — User preferences

## Security

- **Watch-only** — No private keys, read-only address monitoring only
- **Local data** — All data stored in browser localStorage
- **No backend required** — All API calls made directly from the browser
- **No tracking** — No analytics, no cookies, no third-party scripts
